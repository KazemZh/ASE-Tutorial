# ASE Tutorial — *Thermodynamik für Modellierung und Simulation*

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial introducing the **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)** for the course *Thermodynamik für Modellierung und Simulation*.  

The tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Build and visualize atomic and nanoparticle structures.  
- Perform structure optimization using classical **EAM** potentials.  
- Apply modern **MACE** machine-learning force fields.  
- Compare accuracy and performance between EAM and MACE.

## Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.9  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- ASE  
- Torch

## Getting Started

1. Download the file **`ase_tutorial.zip`** from this repository.  
2. Unzip it in your preferred working directory.  
3. Open the notebook:
   - Either directly in **Jupyter Notebook**, or  
   - Through an IDE such as **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  
4. Run the cells step by step to explore ASE, EAM, and MACE simulations.
